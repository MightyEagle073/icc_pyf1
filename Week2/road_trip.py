# By [your name] on [date]
#
# You are about to go on a road trip to Melbourne! You know that it will take 8
# hours to get there, and you also know that the road that you will be taking,
# the Hume Highway, has a speed limit of 110km/h. However, you don't know how
# long it will take. Your job is to calculate how long the journey will be!
# 
# Output: The program will tell you the distance of the journey in a full 
# sentence.
#
# Your program must make use of the variables below! If those variables are not
# used, you will receive a 0 for this exercise!
