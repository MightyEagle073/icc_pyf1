# ICC Python Fundamentals 1, Week 2, Exercise 1: year_5.py
# By [your name] on [date]
#
# Welcome to Aiseesee Public School, where there are 4 classes in year 5: 5C,
# 5E, 5G and 5S. This program is supposed to add up the total number of students
# in the year, however, it... doesn't quite seem to do so! Can you fix up the
# program?
# 
# Output: The number of students there are in year 5.
#
# Your program MUST use the f-string method! Failure to do so will result in a
# 0 for this exercise!

students_in_5e = "27"
